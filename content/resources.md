On this page you're going to find the tools and technology I use to keep this website running.

### Static Site Generator
##### [Hugo](https://www.gohugo.io)

I don't know if you know this: But this website is just plain HTML. I create a series of templates and content files that reference each other as GoLang objects (essentially) and then a piece of software called *Hugo* runs and in 0.748s (most recent build time) compiles everything together and spits out a plain HTML website.

You can learn more about the JAMstack [here](https://www.jamstack.org).

### "Hosting"
#### [GitHub](https://www.github.com)

Traditional hosting is kind of dead anymore, I think? I mean, I'm sure people out there are still using HostGator, or whatever, but with the advent of cloud architecture and serverless structures, technologies like Docker, etc. I don't know, man, I just don't see people paying for traditional hosting.

This website is technically a *Git repo* (which you can view [here](), if you want.)

I use  as my Static Site Generator (learn more about SSGs and the JAMStack ). I use  for version control, and I deploy with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), who have an incredibly powerful CI/CD infrastructure (that does so much more!)."
