My name is Remy Sheppard. I'm a Christian, husband, animal welfare advocate, and nerd.

I spend my time split between way too many activities and hobbies, including reading and streaming video games over on my [TomatoBagle YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channelUCCf_SKbCf-YvAEMbwwN4rFw).

When I'm not at work, I enjoy spending time with my wife of 8 years. We have 3 great little cats  we love to death that the Lord has put in our care.

I'm currently studying to be a pastor in the [American Association of Lutheran Churches](https://www.taalc.org) and hope to have my studies completed and be ordained sometime before 2025.

I have been building and developing websites for over 20 years, and I usually use this domain as my own little playground.

Currently, I'm powering this slice of the internet with a few different services. I use [Hugo](https://www.gohugo.io) as my Static Site Generator (learn more about SSGs and the JAMStack [here](https://www.jamstack.org)). I use [GitHub](https://www.github.com) for version control, and I deploy with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), who have an incredibly powerful CI/CD infrastructure (that does so much more!)."
